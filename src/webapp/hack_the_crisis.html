						<h2>Information for Hackaton submission</h2>
						<p>About</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						Vårdoptimeraren was created as a submission to the Swedish <a href="https://www.hackthecrisis.se/"> Hack the Crisis</a>
						hackaton and in response to the global COVID-19 healthcare crisis.
						This page gathers deliverables and our thoughts as to how the solution could be put into use.
					 	Happy reading!

						<p>The Action Plan</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						David writes this tomorrow. <br/>
						Basically:<br/>
						1. Application specific knowledge is key for implementing machine learning and decision optimization<br/>
						2. We don't have it.<br/>
						3. We have therefore created a solution that we think is interesting and could be helpful<br/>
						4. The next step would be to meet with a representative from the healthcare system to discuss what changes to do and how it could be used<br/>
						5. The optimization solution could easily be changed (e.g. new objective, look at individual hospitals instead of regions, use other forecasts as input etc)<br/>

						<p>Why Vårdoptimeraren rocks</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						David writes this tomorrow.<br/> Basically lead a convincing argument about how we tick all the boxes in the evaluation criteria:<br/>
						Evaluation criteria:<br/>
						* Realisability - In the midst of the crisis, is this a solution that we can use? Is it resourceful? Do we have all the needed data? What are the risks? How soon can we get the solution to the intended users in the middle of this crisis? Is the technology mature enough? How much effort is required?<br/>
						* Benefit for society – Benefits that the solution would bring to society when realized. Which groups of people impacted by the crisis would benefit from this solution? How extensive are the benefits?<br/>
						* Scalability – Scalability of the solution if it is implemented and realized. How many groups of people impacted by the virus are experiencing the problem and pain? What is the expected demand? How many of them can use this solution? Could this solution be scaled if the crisis grows exponentially?<br/>
						* Comprehensibility – Is it easy to understand the solution? How it works and how it will be implemented? How well is the solution detailed? Does it include a description of the key segments of people that will benefit from it under this crisis situation? Will the final users of the solution understand it too or do they need special skills to take part?<br/>
						* Execution – Based on the demo/presentation, is this a well executed solution? How far is the solution developed? How well was it presented?<br/>
						*	Digital Solution: Is the prototype working fully? If not, how well does it work?<br/>
						*	Concept Solution: Is the concept detailed enough to implement? Is there a need for further development before one gets started?<br/>
