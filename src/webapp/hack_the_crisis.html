						<p>About</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						Vårdoptimeraren was created as a submission to the Swedish <a href="https://www.hackthecrisis.se/"> Hack the Crisis</a>
						hackaton and in response to the global COVID-19 healthcare crisis.
						This page gathers deliverables and our thoughts as to how the solution could be put into use.
					 	Happy reading!
					</p>

						<p>The Action Plan</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						From the start of this hackaton, we knew that we wanted to use our knowledge of advanced analytics to create solutions for the healthcare system. We also knew that industry-specific knowledge is key to implementing good machine learning and decision optimization solutions. Since we lack a deep understanding of the healthcare system and its ongoing resource allocation problems, we had a decision to make. We could either create a concept solution and write about all the things we could do if we had access to more specific knowledge about the problems currently facing the system, or we could pick a problem that we think is representative of those challenges and show that we could create a working technical platform for that problem within only a couple of days. We chose the latter.
					</p>
					<p>
						To actually put this solution into use, we would need to meet a representative that works with the overarching resource allocation for the healthcare system and discuss their problems in more detail. This would include answering questions such as:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>What other forecasts does the state have access to? How sophisticated are they? How well do our forecasts do in comparison? </li>
						<li>Which problems should we apply decision optimization to? Should optimizations be inter- or intraregional? Should they aim to move patients or move capacity (e.g. doctors, equipment etc)?</li>
					</ol>
					<p>By creating and deploying the demo solution shown on this website, we have created the infrastructure for handling a wide range of different problems. Once we get access to more specific information about the needs of the healthcare system, we can easily change our optimization solution in accordance. Working together with the healthcare system, we can put this solution into production in days, not weeks. </p>

					<header class="major special">
						<p>Why Vårdoptimeraren rocks</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						Vårdoptimeraren could directly benefit all patients in need of ICU-care around this country. Exactly how this would be depends on the final decision and details regarding implementation. We dare say that proactively being able to transfer either patients or healthcare equipment could be a game changer when facing the upcoming challenge. While it is hard to make quantitative assumptions with the limited data we have, we know that for instance ventilators can mean the difference between life and death. They better be where they are needed.
					</p>
					<p>
						What makes these kinds of systems so powerful is that they can fully harness the processing power of modern computers. Being able to simultaneously account for thousands of parameters while assessing millions of possible solutions, our optimization solution is much more scalable than human decision making.
					</p>

					<header class="major special">
						<p>What data we would need</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						For this submission, we have used mockup data where we lack access to good information. The data dependencies are:
					</p>
					<strong><p>For the forecasting model:</p></strong>
					<ol>
						<li>SIR data about ICU-cases in Sweden</li>
						<li>Current ICU occupancy numbers (in the demo, we have supposed that patients stay in the ICU for 15 days).</li>
					</ol>
					<strong><p>For the optimization solution:</p></strong>
					<ol>
						<li>Data on the number of total ICU-beds per region (In the demo, we have used mockup data)</li>
						<li>Current ICU occupancy numbers (in the demo, we have used our forecasts and the assumptions above). </li>
					</ol>
